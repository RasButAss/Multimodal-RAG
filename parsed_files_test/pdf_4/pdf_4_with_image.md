The image is a screenshot of an article from the journal "Biological Research". The article is titled "An Exploration Of Microbial Response To Stressors With Prof. Claudio C. Vásquez Guzmán" and it discusses the microbial response to various stressors, particularly in the context of Chilean environments. The article is written by Michael Seeger, Raymond J. Turner, and Mauricio González.

The image shows a photograph of a man sitting at a desk with a phone to his ear. He is wearing a blue shirt and glasses. The background of the photo is blurred, but it appears to be an indoor setting with a painting on the wall.

The text in the image provides information about the article's focus on the study of bacterial stress response, particularly that of metal ion stress. It mentions the diversity of extreme environments in Chile and the anthropogenic-produced or released pollutants that include toxic metals. The article also discusses the unique physiologies and genomics of microorganisms remaining in extreme ecological niches similar to those mentioned.

Bacteria have evolved impressive responses to various stressors, which have been essential for the adaptation and evolution of microorganisms and colonization of a wide range of environments. Tis special issue of Biological Research on microbial response to stressors is a tribute of the Chilean and international scientifc community to the late Professor Claudio C. Vásquez Guzmán 
(1952–2020) who dedicated his career in environmental microbiology and biochemistry to the study of bacterial stress response, particularly that of metal ion stress.

Microbes were the frst living cells on Earth. Tey have co-evolved with the planet and thus have experienced a wide range of geological changes that have produced a wide variety of ecological niches and stressors. Stressors to microbial life include expected physical and chemical concerns such as: temperature, pressure, redox state, pH, ionic strength, osmolarity, UV light exposure and shear forces. Additionally, other stressors exist such as low availability of key nutrients, carbon sources, scarcity in electron acceptors, antimicrobial compounds, and also anthropogenicproduced or released pollutants that include toxic metals.

A wide range of natural extreme environments that are inhabited by extreme microorganisms are present world-wide. However, Chile has remarkable diversity, from the Atacama Desert and Altiplano highlands in the North to Patagonia and Antarctic regions in the South, and from South Pacifc and Rapa Nui Island in the West to the Andes Mountains in the East [1]. In addition, polluted environments due to anthropogenic activities (e.g., 
mining, petroleum transport and processing, chemical

industries, agriculture, forestry, and aquaculture) generate extreme conditions and are of increasing concern. 

As such, Chilean scientists have explored such niches in various felds, particularly microbiology.

Stress from such sources is a curious phenomenon for microbes. Microbes acquired tolerance mechanisms towards various geological epoch stressors, which may or may not be present in the Anthropocene [2]. Certainly, unique physiologies from evolved genomics exist for those species remaining in extreme ecological niches similar to thosethe marine bacterium *Alcaligenes aquatilis* QD168 isolated from Quintero Bay, Central Chile, reveal a robust adaptive response to environmental stressors.
