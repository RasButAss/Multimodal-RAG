###### Abstract

Elimination of HIV-1 requires clearance and removal of integrated proviral DNA from infected cells and tissues. Here, sequential long-acting slow-effective release antiviral therapy (LASER ART) and CRISPR-Cas9 demonstrate viral clearance in latent infectious reservoirs in HIV-1 infected humanized mice. HIV-1 subgenomic DNA fragments, spanning the long terminal repeats and the Gag gene, are excised in vivo, resulting in elimination of integrated proviral DNA; virus is not detected in blood, lymphoid tissue, bone marrow and brain by nested and digital-droplet PCR as well as RNAscope tests. No CRISPR-Cas9 mediated off-target effects are detected. Adoptive transfer of human immunocytes from dual treated, virus-free animals to uninfected humanized mice fails to produce infectious progeny virus. In contrast, HIV-1 is readily detected following sole LASER ART or CRISPR-Cas9 treatment. These data provide proof-of-concept that permanent viral elimination is possible.

## Article

* According to UNAIDS, it is estimated that more than 36.7 million people worldwide are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type one (HIV-1) and \(>\)5000 individuals worldwide are newly infected each day. In the clinic, antiretroviral therapy (ART) restricts viral infection by stalling various steps of the viral life cycle. However, ART fails to eliminate integrated copies of HIV-1 proviral DNA from the host genome [1, 2]. As such, virus persists in a latent state within infectious reservoirs; and ART cessation readily leads to viral reactivation and disease progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) [3]. Thus, a major issue for any HIV-1 curative strategy is the means to eliminate either integrated proviral DNA or the cells that harbor virus without collateral cytotoxic reactions. However, elimination of HIV-1 infection in its infected human host is documented only in two individuals [4, 5]. There are several reasons why success has not yet been realized. This includes inadequate therapeutic access to viral reservoirs, rapid spread of infection by continuous sources of virus and susceptible cells and a failure to eliminate residual latent integrated proviral DNA. All single or combination therapeutic approaches preclude HIV-1 cure as viral rebound universally follows ART cessation [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Yet, another obstacle towards elimination of infection is that viral latency is established after infection onset and precedes peak viremia. This underscores that early intervention with potent antiretroviral medicines may help to further reduce the size of the reservoir and ultimately facilitate viral elimination [11]. Therefore, multimodal robust pharmaceutical strategies are needed for complete elimination of HIV-1 if no viral resurgence after cessation of ART is to be achieved. To address this need and design a suitable therapeutic strategy, our laboratories produce highly hydrophobic lipophilic viral reservoir penetrating antiretroviral prodrugs coined as long-acting slow-effective release ART (LASER ART). LASER ART properties are defined by slow drug dissolution, enhanced lipophilicity, improved bioavailability and limited off-target toxicities, which directly affect the frequency of ART administration from daily to weeks. These reduce disease co-modribidity in small animals and maintains effective antiretroviral drug concentrations in blood and tissue viral reservoirs from days to weeks [12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. Macrophages enable uptake of significant amounts of intracellular antiretroviral drug crystals and tightly control ongoing viral replication by the cells' slow drug release and transfer to adjacent CD4 + T cells during cell-to-cell contact or through direct drug uptake [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. However, LASER ART alone cannot rid the infected host of latent HIV-1 no matter how successful the drugs may prove to be at restricting viral infection. Thus, in parallel, we develop CRISPR-Cas9 based gene editing technology using AAV9 delivery that specifically and efficiently excises fragments of integrated HIV-1 proviral DNA from the host genome [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115]. We realize that CRISPR-Cas9-based technologies could be most effective in the setting of maximal viral restriction and substantive reductions in the absolute proviral DNA load. Thus, the two approaches are combined to examine whether LASER ART and CRISPR-Cas9 treatments could provide combinatorial benefit for viral elimination. Here we demonstrate elimination of replication competent HIV-1 in an experimental model of human infectious disease. Viral clearance is achieved from HIV-1 infected spleen and lymphoid tissues as well as a broad range of solid organs from documented prior infected humanized mice treated with LASER ART and AAV9-CRISPR-Cas9. This is confirmed in those mice using ultrasensitive HIV-1 nucleic acid detection methods by the absence of post-treatment viral rebound; and by the inability to transfer virus from those infected and dual-treated mice to replicate uninfected untreated mice. We conclude that viral elimination by a combination of LASER ART and gene editing strategy is possible.

## Results

### Creation and characterization of HIV-1 infected humanized mice.

With the knowledge that few small animal models of HIV-1 reflect actual viral reservoirs and long-term infections, another system for study is required. This is based both on known species restrictions for HIV-1 infection and long-term establishment of tissue reservoirs of infection. Human hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) reconstituted NOD\(\_\)Gg-Prd\(\mathbf{k}^{\text{c}}\)id 1l2rgtm\(\mathbf{l}\)W/SzJ (NSG) mice produce human T cells, that are broadly susceptible to HIV-1 infection [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]. The model permits evaluation of long-term viral infection in blood and tissues and ART-induced HIV-1 latency. To affirm the model's relevance for studies of HIV-1 elimination, we undertook a detailed evaluation of each of the human cell-virus model components (Fig. 1). _First_, after irradiation of mice at birth, animals were germated with human CD34 + HSC isolated from cord blood by a single intrahepatic injection. The presence of human immunocytes in blood was confirmed by flow cytometry. _Second_, four months after humanization was confirmed animals were infected with HIV-1ADA at 10\({}^{4}\) tissue culture infection dose\({}_{50}\) (TCID\({}_{50}\)/animal and analyzed for acute (14 days) (Fig. 1a-d) and chronic (16 weeks infection) (Fig. 1e-g) paradigm. At sacrifice, human cell reconstitution was confirmed in tissues (spleen, lymph node, liver, lung and brain) by immunohistochemical staining with human HLA-DR antibodies. Anatomical localizations and lymphocyte prominence were confirmed by human cell penetration into the white and red pulp and germinal centers of spleen. Lymph nodes were enriched with human cells with anatomical distinctions in the cortex, medulla and germinal centers. _Third_, productive HIV-1 infection was confirmed by HIV-1p24 staining as shown by large numbers of stained cells. Infection was highest in lymphoid compartments as compared to liver, lung and brain. A significant CD4 + T-cell decline and increased CD8 + T-cell numbers were observed as a consequence of sustained HIV-1 infection. The percentage of human CD4 + T cells in mice was determined in blood by flow cytometry at 2, 6, 11, and 15 weeks and showed decline after infection (Fig. 1f). Plasma viral RNA copies/ml 16 weeks after HIV-1 infection were readily observed (Fig. 1g).

### Generation and pharmacokinetic (PK) testing of LASER ART.

We posit that use of CRISPR-Cas9 strategies developed for the elimination of HIV-1 proviral DNA are aided by optimal control of viral replication leading to sustained viral latency (supplementary fig. 1). To this end amongst others, our laboratories have developed LASER ART that facilitates sustained inhibition of viral replication by long-acting hydrophobic lipophilic antiretroviral nanoparticles [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. To accomplish this goal, fatty-acid-modified prodrugs were synthesized as prodrugs for doltgetravir (DTG), lamivudine (3TC) and abacavir (ABC) by esterification with myristic acid. The chemical structures and physicochemical properties were characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and powder X-ray diffraction [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. The LASER ART particles were characterized fully for stability, size, and shape. This included human monocyte-derived macrophage (MDM) nanoparticle drug uptake, release and potency. Data sets were obtained for nanoformalted myristivolated NM (NMDTG), NM3TC and NMABC prodrugs and nanoformalized rilpivirine (NRPV) (Table 1) before being used in the animal studies. These included individual antiretroviral activity for each of the nanoformulations. Moreover, complete PK profiles were performed for each of the nanoformulated drugs after a single drug nanoformulation injection. These are illustrated with the accompanying dosages administered in BALB/c mice (Table 1). The PK measurements including terminal rateconstant (\(\lambda\)z) and half-life (t\({}_{1/2}\)), area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), apparent volume of distribution (V\({}_{\text{b}}\)/F), total plasma clearance of drug (CL/F), mean resident time (of the unchanged drug in the systemic circulation) (MRT), were outlined in prior works [25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. These data sets showed tight control over viral replication, and the short tail of drug removal from blood and tissue affirmed that any lack of viral rebound would accurately reflect residual HIV-1 growth rather than any residual antiretroviral drug present as part of the long-acting regimen.

\(15\pm 6\%\) and \(<6\%\) in groups \(2\) and \(1\), respectively (Fig. 2b). The CD\({\rm{}}+{\rm{}T}\) cell profile of each animal is shown (Fig. 3) for all treatment groups. Disease was determined by declining percentages of CD\({\rm{}}4+{\rm{}T}\) cells. Results showed a robust restoration of CD\({\rm{}}4+{\rm{}T}\) cells in the animals that received LASER ART alone or in combination with AAV\({}_{9}\)-CRISPR-Cas9 as compared to infected controls and AAV\({}_{9}\)-CRISPR-Cas9 alone treated animals (Figs. 2b and 3).

Next, we evaluated the number of total human cells (CD\({\rm{}}45+{\rm{}T}\)) and T cells (CD\({\rm{}}3+{\rm{}T}\)) by flow cytometry and demonstrated sustained human cell numbers in both control (uninfected), infected and treated animals at and beyond four months until the study conclusion (Fig. 4a, b respectively). The presence of human CD4 + cells (Fig. 4c) and HLA-DR in spleen was observed to confirm graft stability. We also observed restoration of CD4 + T cells in spleens of dual-treated animals (Fig. 4c). This was further confirmed by the identification of species-specific DNA sequences in spleens of all animal groups independent of treatments administered (Fig. 4d). Indeed, cell numbers proved constant following all CRISPR-Cas9 and LASER ART interventions.

**HIV-1 elimination in LASER ART and CRISPR-Cas9-treated mice.** Next, we determined viral DNA and RNA levels in tissues (Fig. 5) using ultrasensitive semi-nested real-time qPCR with primers and probes designed for detection of HIV-1 gang. DNA analysis revealed that combination treatment (\(n\) = 7) was more effective than either LASER ART (\(n\) = 10) or CRISPR-Cas9 alone (\(n\) = 6) in DNA copy reductions. The spleen, bone marrow (BM), gut, brain, liver, kidney, and lung of mice M4346 and M4349 showed no rebound. Results from targeted qPCR for DNA sequence detection excluded the presence of DNA corresponding to _pol_ and _env_ genes in the two, dual-treated and virus eradicated animals (Fig. 5a-c). Similarly, results from the RNA detection assay corroborated these results and showed that combination of LASER ART and CRISPR-Cas9 reduced HIV-1 RNA in select animals with complete absence of viral RNA in M4346 and M4349 (Fig. 5d). The presence of HIV-1 RNA was also examined by RNAscope using 5 um thick spleen sections from infected animals and antisense probe V-HIV-1 Clade-B designed for targeting base pairs 854-8291 of HIV-1NLA-3 (Fig. 5e). Viral DNA and RNA were not detected in plasma or tissues from both mice. Cells and tissues obtained from mouse M4346 contained no viral nucleic acid (Fig. 5e). Further evidence supporting the absence of HIV-1 genomes in animals M4346 and M4349 was provided by digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) (supplementary fig. 2). Verifying prior qPCR results, no viral DNA/RNA (assay's detection sensitivity of \(<\) 2 viral copies) was detected in spleen, bone marrow, and gut of mice M4346 and M4349. The data, taken together, all support the findings of complete HIV-1 elimination. In further cross validation tests, viral rescue assays were performed by co-culturing bone marrow cells and splenocytes of representative animals with phytohemagglutinin/interleukin-2 (PHA/IL-2)-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). These tests were performed for an additional two weeks. Representative data from these experiments showed that while HIV-1 was rescued from 100% of samples with detectable viral DNA and RNA, no evidence for virus recovery was observed in the samples from the two animals (M4346 and M4349) where HIV-1 DNA and RNA were eliminated despite the presence of high numbers of human cells (supplementary fig. 3).

**On and Off target CRISPR-Cas9 effects.** We next evaluated on and off target CRISPR-Cas9 effects in infected and treated animals. In these experiments, gel electrophoresis was performed in PCR-amplified DNA fragments from infected and treated animals using pairs of primers designed to detect cleavage (Fig. 6). As expected, excision of viral DNA fragments was readily observed from spleen, gut, and kidney samples of animals treated with LASER ART and CRISPR-Cas9 (Fig. 6b). Excision of the predicted fragment in lung, liver, and brain amongst other tissues was also observed (supplementary fig. 4). The excision type differed in the various tissues amongst animals. The integrity and precision of the HIV-1 DNA excision by CRISPR-Cas9 were verified by sequencing (Fig. 6c, and supplementary figs. 5-7). In mice that received CRISPR-Cas9 without LASER ART, fragmental deletion was detected. Several other DNA fragments in tissues from animals that received LASER ART alone were amplified, but after sequencing were found unrelated to HIV or CRISPR-Cas9 editing. This observation likely represented replication defective HIV-1 (highlighted by double asterisks, Fig. 6b). The efficiency of the proviral DNA excision by CRISPR-Cas9 in the spleens of two infected humanized mice from the CRISPR-Cas9 and LASER ART group (animals where no rebound was observed) was determined by ddPCR. Excision efficiency was estimated to be 80% in both 5'-LTR-Gag and Gag to 3'-LTR in mouse M4349. Transduction efficiency was determined by ddPCR and ranged from 0.12-1.03 AAV vector copies/cell (Fig. 6d-f). Amplification of the DNA fragments corresponding to the control housekeeping actin gene in tissues and expression of gRNAs and Cas9 are shown in supplementary fig 8.

Clustering analysis revealed similar excision patterns with high efficiency across the tissues in animals that received dual treatments compared to those that received CRISPR-Cas9 alone (supplementary fig. 9). However, results from sequencing of several selected sites with high scores of specificities and/or their locations in the exons ruled out off-target effects (supplementary figs. 10 and 11, and supplementary table 3). Further, results from whole genome deep sequencing of DNA from spleens of four treated animals, including two animals that showed no rebound after dual treatment and one from each of the two single treatment groups was performed and then confirmed by bioinformatics analyses. No detectable off target effects on more than one hundred predicted sites that were seen can be attributed to CRISPR. This was done by identifying somatic genomic alterations including structural variants (SVs), single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), copy number variations (CNVs) and

Fig. 2: Viral load and CD4 + T cells in HIV-1 infected and treated humanized mice. Mice were infected with 10\({}^{4}\) TCD1/g0 of HIV-1NLA-4 followed by treatments with LASER ART, CRISPR-Cas9 or both. **a** The study scheme shows the times of infection and treatments. After confirmation of viral infection, 29 infected humanized mice were subdivided into four groups. The first group (\(n\) = 6, red) were left untreated (control), the second group (\(n\) = 6, black) received a single intravenous (IVD dose of AAV\({}_{\alpha}\)-CRISP-Cas9) (10\({}^{2}\) units), nine weeks after viral infection, the third group (\(n\) = 10, blue) were administered LASER ART (NMDTG and NRPV at 45 mg/kg and NM3RC at 40 mg/mg) by intramuscular (IM) injection two weeks after viral infection, the fourth (\(n\) = 7, green) were given LASER ART (\(\alpha\)s in group 3) and three weeks after the last LASER ART treatment, a single IV dose of AAV\({}_{\alpha}\)-CRISP-Cas9 was administered as in group 2. LASER ART treatment was ceased and after an additional five weeks, antiretroviral drug levels were assessed and were at or below the limit of quantitation < 1 mg/ml (Table 1). **b** Flow cytometry for human CD4 + T cells are shown with increased numbers of CD4 counts in the LASER ART and dual LASER ART and CRISPR-Cas9 groups. **c** Evaluation of plasma viral load indicated that after administration of AAV\({}_{\alpha}\)-CRISP-Cas9, 2, 7 of mice showed no evidence for viral rebound at 14 weeks. **d** Plasma viral load of individual animals for different treatment groups of humanized mice were assayed at 2, 7, 9, and 14 weeks of HIV-1 infection for HIV-1 RNA. Viral RNA levels were determined by the COBAS Amplipre-Taqman-48 V2.0 assay with a sensitivity of 200 copies/ml once adjusted to the plasma dilution factor. Viral RNA rebound was observed at the study end in all 10 LASER ART treated animals. This corresponded to eight weeks after therapy interruption. Rebound was also observed at the study end in 5 of 7 dual-treated animals. Virus was not observed in two dual-treated animals (M4346 and M4349) and are highlighted in the red boxes. Source data are provided as a source data file small insertion and deletion (InDel) mutations under different treatments and comparing these with all potential off-targets (supplementary Tables 1-5 and figs. 10-13).

**Validation for LASER ART and CRISPR-Cas9 HIV-1 therapeutic elimination**. To validate eradication of HIV-1 infection, we performed replicate experiments in a separate set of HSC-reconstituted NSG mice infected with a second macrophage tropic viral strain (HIV-\(1_{\mathrm{ADA}}\)) (Fig. 7a). Animals were infected with \(10^{4}\) TCID\({}_{50}\) of HIV-\(1_{\mathrm{ADA}}\) for two-weeks, at which time depletion of CD4 + T cells was observed and viral RNA copies in plasma were recorded at a median level of \(8.4\times 10^{4}\) copies/ml(Fig. 7b-c). Semi-nested real-time qPCR of HIV-1 nucleic acid confirmed tissue viral infection from three representative animals. Infected animals were divided into three groups, a no treatment infected group (\(n=4\)); those that received LASER ART (combinations of DTG, RPV, 3TC, and ABC) with (\(n=6\)) or without CRISPR-Cas9 (\(n=7\)). Animals were observed for ten weeks after cessation of LASER ART for viral rebound. Continuous viral replication was readily observed in untreated animals and those treated with only LASER ART. Notably, three of six LASER ART and CRISPR-Cas9-dual-treated animals had no demonstrabile viral rebound (Fig. 7c). In these mice, protection of CD4\({}^{+}\) T cell counts (\(71.3\pm 3.5\%\)) was observed compared to infected controls (\(48.3\pm 4.5\%\)) (Fig. 7b). The CD4\({}+\) T cell and viral load profiles for each of the individual animals are shown (supplementary figs. 14-15). As in the first experiment, detection of human DNA sequences in spleen confirmed uniform presence of human cells in lymphoid tissues of all humanized mice regardless of treatment. Moreover, no evidence of viral gene expression was found in another two animals (M3319 and M3336) employing qPCR tests for DNA sequence detection (Fig. 7d). HIV-1 genome amplification was also absent in these two mice and were confirmed by the ddPCR (Fig. 8a) and RNAscope tests (supplementary fig. 16). One animal out of three that had no demonstrabile rebound in plasma showed detectable HIV-1 DNA in tissues (split red-black structure, Fig. 7d), confirming the important role that tissue reservoirs play during HIV-1 infection. Viral DNA by PCR, gel electrophoresis, and Sanger sequencing verified the ability of CRISPR-Cas9 to excise the target DNA fragment positioned between the LTR and GagD (Fig. 8b and supplementary fig. 17).

Finally, splenocytes and bone marrow cells were isolated from HIV-1 infected mice with or without prior LASER ART and/or CRISPR-Cas9 treatments at the study end. These cells were used in adoptive transfer studies performed in uninfected drug naive humanized mice to examine the potential rebound from latent reservoirs not detected by standard ddPCR and nested PCR. In addition, as positive controls, two animals from the HIV-1 infected group, one from the LASER ART alone treatment group and five animals from the dual treatment group were used as controls for adoptive transfers (Fig. 8c and supplementary fig. 18). Recipient mice were sacrificed after 30 days and analyzed for plasma viral RNA. Virus was not detected in plasma from animals that received splenocytes or bone marrow cells isolated from sequentially LASER ART CRISPR-Cas9-treated animals (M3319 and M3336). In contrast, virus was readily identified in all virus infected or virus infected and LASER ART treated animals. One animal each from the HIV-1- and dual-treated bone marrow injected group died prior to the assay performance and as such these data were not included. In conclusion, the in vivo viral outgrowth assays performed from virus eliminated dual-treated mice to new uninfected recipient humanized mice failed to demonstrate viral recovery after one month following adoptive transfers (Fig. 8c). Also, no histopathological evidence for cytotoxicities were detected in any of the animals by conventional microscopic test evaluations of liver (supplementary fig. 19).

To provide an additional level of confirmation to these observations, a third series of studies using replicate procedures were performed. Here, we confirmed the ability of LASER ART and CRISPR-Cas9 to eliminate viral rebound in a new cohort of CD34 \(+\) HSC-reconstituted animals infected with HIV-1\({}_{\text{ADA}}\). The outcome of the virological assays showed no evidence of the presence of replication competent virus in four out of ten animals tested after removal of LASER ART in the dual therapy group (supplementary Table 6). All HIV-1 animals that received no or single treatments showed viral rebound after treatment was stopped. Notably, in all three experiments and in all treatment groups, no demonstrabile changes in the animals' well-being or histopathology were observed.

Altogether, the results from three independent sets of studies revealed that a third or more of the animals that received sequential LASER ART and CRISPR-Cas9 therapy became virus free (supplementary Table 6). Most likely, successful outcomes for virus elimination in these animals reflect a combination of factors that include viral set points, extent of a previously established tissue viral reservoir, efficient intracellular and tissue delivery of LASER ART, transduction efficiency and excision therapy at sites of viral growth. Future work will begin to dissect each and all of these factors pointing to viral elimination pathways.

LASER ART was administered then removed with consequent CRISPR-Cas9 excision. Plasma drug levels were monitored until they reached levels that were at or below the limit of detection. In these three independent experiments, one with HIV-1\({}_{\text{NIH-4}}\) and the other two with HIV-1\({}_{\text{ADA}}\) infection of humanized mice, single treatments with LASER ART or AAV\({}_{\text{g}}\)-CRISPR-Cas9 resulted in viral rebound in 100% of treated infected animals. In dual LASER ART and AAV\({}_{\text{g}}\)-CRISPR-Cas9-treated mice, virus was eliminated from cell and tissue reservoirs in up to a third of infected animals as illustrated (Fig. 9).

## Discussion

While ART has transformed HIV-1 infection into a chronic treatable disease, virus persists in tissues that include the gut, lymph nodes, brain, spleen amongst other sites. The inability of ART to eliminate virus in these tissue sancuaries remains the major obstacle towards a disease cure. Such a limitation is linked, in large measure, to continuous long-term infections in CD4\({}^{+}\) memory T cells and less frequently in mononuclear phagocytes despite both directed host antiviral immunity and ART effectiveness. Thus, one may predict that, any or all steps towards HIV elimination must include precise targeted ART delivery, maintenance of vigorous immune control, effective blockade of viral growth and immune-based elimination of pools of infected cells or genome integrated proviral DNA. Even under these conditions, the presence of replication competent virus that allows low-levels of viral production and viral latency underscores employment of strategies that eliminate virus that is integrated but latent. Because of notable graft versus host disease in several humanized

LASER ART was eliminated eight weeks after treatment. **d** CD4 \(+\) T cells of HIV-1 infected and LASER ART and AAV\({}_{\text{g}}\)-CRISPR-Cas9-treated animals (\(n=7\), green). Decreased CD4 \(+\) T cell numbers were seen as early as two weeks after infection. At this time, LASER ART was administered for four weeks followed by AAV\({}_{\text{g}}\)-CRISPR-Cas9 given at week 9. The mice were then followed for an additional five weeks. Restoration of CD4\({}^{+}\) T cells was observed in both LASER ART and LASER ART and AAV\({}_{\text{g}}\)-CRISPR-Cas9 treatment groups. Source data are provided as a source data file animal models, examinations for time periods measured in months are limited. In order to overcome the challenge of sustained human grafts in mice, we adopted NSG-humanized mice transplanted at birth with HSC. Both human myeloid and lymphoid lineages were successfully reconstituted in these mice and support the evaluations of HIV-1 persistence, treatment, and immune functions [17, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38]. The sustained human grafts as confirmed by flow cytometry were viable and functional for more than 6 months, which provided a platform that allowed treatment interventions for prolonged time periods and a clear ability during ART to best establish a continuous latent HIV-1 reservoir in peripheral tissues and the brain and the noted immunological

recent studies, we demonstrated that inclusion of quadruplex of gRNAs for targeting Gag, Pol and two separate sites within the LTRs may yield slightly higher efficiency of viral DNA excision [24]. It is important to note that in those studies we employed a different mouse model, distinct AAV delivery system, and more importantly, different timelines for HIV-1 infection and viral DNA harvesting for conventional semi-quantitative PCR assays. In recent studies, we combined bioimaging, antiretroviral PK and sensitive tissue biodistribution studies to facilitate ART delivery into cell and tissue viral reservoirs in both humanized mice and non-human primates. These combined diagnostic and therapeutic modalities, coined theranostics, are being developed to facilitate effective HIV-1 elimination strategies in an infected human host [56].

In conclusion, we employed a broad range of highly sensitive tests to evaluate HIV-1 elimination by LASER ART and AAV\({}_{g}\)-delivered CRISPR-Cas9 treatments. These included viral gene amplification, flow cytometry, adoptive viral transfers, on target and off target assays, and measures of viral rebound to demonstrate that combination therapies can safely lead to the elimination of HIV-1 infection. Results demonstrated that eradication of replication-competent HIV-1 present in infectious cell and tissue sites of infected animals can be achieved. Although reappearance of viremia in humans can be delayed [5], rebound occurs on average 2 to 4 weeks after ART interruption [57, 58] and 5 to 11 days in humanized mice [59]. Despite the vigorous treatments offered, there was no evidence of outward untoward effects of any therapies (supplementary fig. 19) [12] including the persistence of human adult lymphocytes in mouse plasma and tissue (fig. 4). As such, these proof-of-concept results offer readily defined and realistic pathways toward strategies for HIV-1 elimination. Future studies are designed to improve delivery of agents to viral reservoirs and specifically eliminate residual latent viral infections. This is a first important step towards a longer journey for viral eradication.

## Methods

**Cell culture reagents.** 4-(2-Hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazine methanesulfonic acid (HEPES) buffer and ciprofloxacin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO. Did methyl ether, endotoxin-free water, gentamicin, acetonitrile (ACN), methanosol, KH\({}_{p}\)O\({}_{a}\), bovine serum albumin (BSA), Triton X-100, LC-MS-grade water, and TRal reagent were purchased from Fisher Scientific, San Diego, CA. The T2M-18 report cell time (AIDS Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NAID, NIH, Bethesla, MD) and HEK-293T cells (the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), MANSA) were cultured in high glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and gentamicin (10% FBS/10%). [Nat (Clone B6-1, TR-10%-25%)] cells were purchased from ATCC and cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) medium containing 10% FBS and gentamicin (10%) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). PROTS were isolated from leukopaks by gradient centrifugation on Kiel-Paque for 30 minutes at 600 g. PBMCs collected from the buffy coat were stimulated with PHA (pg/ml) for 2 h in RPMI with 10% FBS and gentamicin (10% pH) supplemented with human recombinant interleukin (2-FIL-2) at a concentration of 30 ng/ml ((STEMCCEL Technologies, Seattle, WA). Fresh media was exchanged every 2-3 days.

**Cell culture HIV-1 infection.** HEK-293T cells were transfected using CaPO\({}_{4}\) precipitation method in the presence of chloroquine (50 uM) with 30 g of pN\({}_{4+,3}\)-EGFP-P2A-Nat plasmid (2-5 x 10 \(\%\)/100 nm) dish. Next day, media were replaced, and 24 and 48 h later experiments were collected, clarified at 1400 g for 10 minutes, filtered through 0.45 um filter, and concentrated by ultracentrifugation for 2 h with 20% sucrose emulsion. Viral pellets were resuspended in Harris's basic Salt Solution (HHS) by gentle agitation overnight, aliquoted, and filtered in Jurkat cells by FACS for GFP expression, Jurkat cells were infected by stimulation for 1.5 h, 32 C in 500 uM inoculum containing 8 g/ml polyrene then resuspended and let fed at 4 h then 500 uM of growth medium was added. Next day, cells were washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and re-suspended in growth medium.

**Design of gRNA, construction of CRISPR-Cas9 expression plasmid and the AAV\({}_{g}\)-CAS9 vector was previously described [4, 21]. Briefly, the Broad Institute gRNA designer tool ([https://www.broadinstitute.org/maisl/public/analysis-tools/spring-design](https://www.broadinstitute.org/maisl/public/analysis-tools/spring-design)) was used to screen HIV-144-3 \(\pi\)ma as aran sequences for possible gRNA protogucger regions followed by sCaS9 genetic PAH. NGGRR (N). A pair of gRNAs showing the best predicted on-target (in HIV-1 genome) and the lowest of-target (in human genome) activities was selected: one targeting the HIV-1 LTR promoter region and the other targeting gene gene. The sequences of respective LTR1 and Gagp gRNA plus PAM were further cross referenced with los Alamos HIV sequence database confirming high levels of conservation (>90%) across the HIV-1 sequences. Next, pair of oligonucleotides for each date with 5-CACC and 3-AAC Baal weightases was obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (IPT, Coralville, Iowa, Table S1), annealed, phosphorylated, and ligated into _I_-B_ digested, dephosphorylated pX601-AAV-CNV-SNS-aS-SNS-aS-Midian-

UPLC-MS/MS. A 40-50 ul volume for each nanformulation combination (NMDTG/NRPV and NMMT/NMABC) was administered by intramuscular (IM) injection in opposing high muscles of the mice.

**Artibodies.** For flow cytometric analysis, we used a panel of antibodies (all from BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) comprised of FITC-conjugated mouse anti-human CD3 (catalog 555843), Alexa Fluor 700-conjugated mouse anti-human CD3 (catalog 5555349), AC-conjugated mouse anti-human CD4 (catalog 5555349), and BV421-conjugated mouse anti-human CD4 (catalog 5555349), and BV421-conjugated mouse anti-human CD4 (catalog 5555349), and PE-C5-conjugated mouse anti-human CD14 (catalog 555398), and PE-C5-conjugated mouse anti-human CD19 (catalog 5555419). For immunohistochemical staining, we used monoclonal mouse anti-human HIV-1924 (catalog 555419), DNA 1:000, and monoclonal mouse anti-human leukocyte antigen (HLA-DR); clone GR3/A3, Dako, 1:100), and the polymer-based HRP-conjugated anti-mouse EnVi - secondary antibodies were purchased from Dako (Cariparentina, CA). Peripheral blood was collected from the submanifold value into ethylenedimetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-coated tubes or by cardiac puncture at the study end. Blood leukocytes were tested for human and CD45, CD3, CD4, CD5, and CD19 markers as six-color combinations using I2R1-FACS FASSACE AND BI Biosciences. Antibodies and isotype controls were obtained from BD Pharmingin, San Diego, CA, and staining was analyzed with a Flooub (BD Immunotherapy Systems, Mountain View, CA). The gating strategy is shown in supplementary fig. 2. Results were expressed as percentages of total number of gated lymphocytes. The percentages of CD4 and CBS positive cells were obtained from human CD3 + gait?. We used absolute counts of human CD45 + cells to normalize each of the human cell data sets. Equivalent numbers of total blood cells/mouse were used at each time point.

**Immunohistochemistry (IHC) examinations.** Spleen, lung, liver, and lymph nodes were perfused with PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehydede and then post-fixed overnight and processed for paraffin embedding. Five-micron thick sections were cut from the paraffin blocks, mounted on glass slides, and labeled with mouse monoclonal antibodies (Dako) for HLA-DQ/DP/DR (clone GR3/A3, 1:100) and HIV-1924 (1:10). The polymer-based flip-conjugated anti-mouse Dale Vision system was used as a secondary detection reagent and developed with 3,3'-dia-minohaemiaemia (DAA) all paraffin-embedded sections were counterstaineded with Mayers hematoxylin. Deletion of primary antibodies or using mouse IgG served as controls. Images were obtained with a Nikon DS-Fi1 camera fixed to a Nikon Eclipse E800 (Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY) using NIS-Elements F 3, 0 software.

**Nucleic acid extractions and qPCR assays.** In studies presented in Fig. 2-8, total viral nucleic acids (RNA and DNA) were extracted from the spleen, bone marrow cells, lung, gut, liver, kidney, and brain using a Qiagen Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total cellular DNA obtained from the HIV-1 infected cell ME4G2 served as a positive control and standards, while human genomic DNA obtained from uninfected NS-hu mice served as a negative control. Cell-associated HIV-1 RNA and DNA were quantified by real-time qPCR and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assays. Because of extremely low numbers of latently-infected human cells in HIV-infected NS-hu mice after long-term ART, detection of total HIV-1 DNA, required two rounds of PCR amplification. The first round of PCR was performed on a conventional PCR machine (T100 Thermal Cyber, Biorad, CA) in 25 ul of PCR reaction mix containing 500 ng of template and 50 ng each of both primers annealing to HIV-1 gag region and the reaction reactions are all follows: 94 C for 3 min, followed by 15 cycles of 94 C for 30 s, 55 C for 30 s, and 72 C for 1 min. The product of the first PCR was subsequently used as a template in the second semi-intend real-time PCR amplification performed on the ABI Step One Plus real-time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using TaqMan detection probe and primers [30]. Two \(\mu\) of the first PCR product was diluted to 50 ul with PCR master mix containing two primers at 0.2 ul and each 0.2 ul TaqMan dual-labeled fluorescent probe. Real-time PCR settings were as follows: 50 C for 2 min, then 95 C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 C for 15 s, and 60 C for 1 min. The melophion sizes are 221 bp for the first round of PCR and 83 bp for the second round (real-time) PCR. DNA extracted from ACII cells containing one integrated copy of HIV-1 per cell was used as standard in serial 10-fold dilutions with HIV copy numbers ranging from 10\({}^{1}\) to 10\({}^{5}\) DNA copies/reaction [30, 31]. Integrated DNA (IDENA) provisions was quantified using an adapted multi-gap PCR assays as described by Agosto et al.[45] with modifications for the second round of PCR, following prior published methods [40]. Briefly, samples underwent at first-round PCR amplification (95 C for 2 min; 20 cycles of 95 C for 15 s, and 72 C for 15 s) using 100 nM and 600 nM step reverse primers. Five of the first-round product were amplified in a nested protocol using the assay for HIV-1 gag gene (second PCR primers and probe), as described above. First-round PCR included 3 replicates using only gag reverse primer (gag only) to serve as background un-integrated control. Integration levels per cell were calculated by subtracting gag-only signals from the Al-gg gag quantification. Semi-nested real-time RT-PCR on HIV-1 DNA was performed as described [40, 31]. The eluted cellular RNA was first subjected to DNase treatment to remove HIV-1 DNA to avoid the interference with the quantitation. For reverse transcription assay, random resources were used as primers and Superscript III (Invitrogen, MA) to synthesize first-strand cDNA at 42 C for 60 min. cDNA was used for the implied (NRAN assay). Two rounds of PCR were performed under the same PCR conditions as described for total viral DNA. For the usRNA assay, real-time PCR was run for 45 cycles and name primers and fluorescent probe as for the total viral DNA assay were used. Human CD45 species-specific primers and probes were obtained from Thermo-Fisher Scientific (USA) (cat. no. 433182 for h300534_gl.).

For viral testing, frozen tissues sent to Temple University from the University of Nebraska Medical Center were homogenized using Bullet Blender homogenizer (Next Advance, Averill Park, NY) using band combinations and setting specific for every tissue according to manufacturer's protocols. T1 Buffer from NucleoSpin Tissue kit (Macherry-Nagd, Duvern, Germany) was used for homogenization/initial lysis followed by very-night proteinase K digestion. Extraction of genomic DNA was completed according to the manufacturer's protocol. For standard PCRs (supplementary Table 1), 500 ng of extracted DNA were subjected to PCR using fetal Safe PCR kit and buffer D (Epicating, Madison, WI) under the following PCR conditions: 94 C 5 min, 30 cycles (94 C 5- 30 s, 55 C- 30 s, 72 C for 30 s), 72 C for 72 min using 1st round primers followed by nested PCR using diluted 1st round PCR reaction. Nested PCR products were subjected to Sanger sequencing directly if only one amplicon population was detected by agarose gel electrophoresis. For multiple neighbors detected, in order to investigate the composition of HIV excision, each amplicon population was separated and purified from an agarose gel electrophoresis and then cloned into TA vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Plasmid DNA containing excised HIV amplicon was purified from each bacterial colony for Sanger sequencing (Genevic, South Plainfield, NJ). HIV-1 DNA was quantified using TaqMan (PCR specific for HIV-1 pdl and em genes and cellular bet-globen gas as a reference (supplementary Table 1). Prior to qPCR genomic DNA was diluted to 10 ng/jl and then 5 ul (50) were taken per reaction/well. Reaction mixtures were prepared using Platinum Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) according to a simplified procedure [40]. Standard was prepared from serial dilutions of U1 cells genomic DNA since it contains two single copies of HIV-1 postures per diploid genome equal to beta-globen gene copy numbers: 98 C 5 min, 45 cycles (98 C 5 min, 45 cycles (98 C 15 s, 60 C 30 s with acquisition, 72 C 1 min). Reactions were carried out and data analyzed in a Light/C666 (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). For RT-PCR, RTzI2 reagent (Anhibition, Austin, TX) was used for initial RNA extraction followed by clean up using RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with DNase I digestion in the extraction column. Total 0.5ug of RNA was used for M-MLV reverse

Predicted amplicons of 193 bp and 523 bp, which result from the excisions of DNA fragments between 51TR to Gag and Gag to 31TR, respectively, were selected for DNA sequencing. The fragment of 396 bp represents both populations of full length LTRs, as well as the chimeric of both 5’ and 31TR after excision of entire proviral genome. Single asterisks above the bands point to the specificity of fragment HIV DNA excision by CRISPR-Cas9 as verified by Sanger sequencing (supplementary figs. 3 and 4). The double asterisk depicts non-specific amplicons (supplementary fig. 2). The dashed boxes show the excised HIV-1 amplicons in the two animals with no viral rebound. **c** Representative DNA sequences from each group were aligned to the reference LTR-Gag region of the HIV-1\({}_{\text{ba-4,3}}\) sequence. The positions and nucleotide compositions of targets for gRNAs LTR1 and GagQ are shown in green, PAM in red, and insertion sequences in yellow. Arrows highlight positions of small and large deletions. **d** Schematic showing locations of each gRNA, the TagMan probe and the possible excision outcomes. **e** Representative ddPCR data for HIV-1 LTR, Gag, and Pol collected from the HIV-infected humanized mouse of each group treated with LASER ART, LASER ART plus AAV\({}_{\text{g}}\)-CRISPR-Cas9 or AAV\({}_{\text{g}}\)-CRISPR-Cas9 only (Cas9) are shown. **f** TaqMan probe and primers specific for sCas9, which was delivered by AAV\({}_{\text{g}}\), were used to determine the AAV transduction efficiency and represented as AAV vector copies/cell. **g** Total human cell population in samples was measured using TaqMan probe and primers specific for human beta-actin.

Validation was made by state of the art viral, immune, and excision detection systems. **a** The timeline of the experiment showing the temporal administration of LASER ART and CRISPR-Cas9 treatment, and animal sacrifice. **b** The percentage of human CD4 + T cells and **c** viral loads measured in the HIV-1 infected (\(n=4\), red). Dual treated animals (\(n=6\), green) that showed no (\(n=3\), green) or viral rebound (\(n=3\), green to red) in plasma. **d** HIV-1 DNA analysis was performed using ultrasensitive semi-nested real-time qPCR assays from spleen, gut, liver, lung, brain and bone marrow from infected (\(n=4\), open circles) and infected and dual-treated mice (\(n=6\), squares). Whole bone marrow isobiled from three animals (out of 6) from the dual-treated rebound group were used for adoptive transfer, Therefore, the data represent \(m=3\) for real-time-PCR assay for the dual-treated animals in the bone marrow adoptive transfer studies. The data are expressed as total HIV-1 DNA copies/10\({}^{6}\) human CD45 + cells. Two animals, M3319 and M3336 (illustrated by the red squares) were below the dashed lines for virus detection as measured by plasma VL. These animals had no detectable viral DNA after dual treatments demonstrating viral sterilization from all analyzed tissues. A single animal (M3324), as illustrated by a half-red-black designation, had an undetectable VL in plasma, but viral DNA was amplified in all the tissues analyzed. Source data are provided as a source data file

and confirmed viral sterilization. Viral rescue was observed in other groups of animals tested.

### Adoptive transfers

Selenocytes and bone marrow cells (\(8-10\times 10^{6}\)) were harvested at the time of sacrifice from NS6-hu mice that were HIV-1ADA infected with and without LASER ART and AAV-CMSIPK-Cang. The cells were adaptively transferred into un manipulated 18-week old CD4 + HSC-SBS mice. Cell counts and viability tests were determined by both trypan blue and live/dead stains on the TC-20 automated cell counter (Bio-Rad). Cells were injected IP into mice and monitored for an additional 4-week. These experiments were performed to cross validate eradication of viral infection that could occur from latent reservoirs and not detected by either qPCR, RNA/ongo, and dPDK assays. Viral load was measured from blood samples of the adoptively transferred mice using automated COBAS Amlipper System V2.0/Tagman-48 system, and immune cell profiles (CD4 and CB-N + cell by flow cytometry) recorded, in parallel. Residual virus from all humanized mice tissues was examined by qPCR and dPDK assays. Virus was not detected in plasma or tissues from two adoptively transferred animals (mice M3319 and M3336).

### Off-target analyses

TZM-bl cells were plated in 6 well plates at \(1\times 10^{5}\) cells/ well and co-transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) with 1 ug of control pX601-AAV-CMV-NLS-SaSaSaS-NLS-3:kHz-delta-toBrA-U6:Bsa1-sgRNA (Adagrange catalog 6195191 or 1 mg of pX601-1TRI-GBAP (20) plasmid together with 0.2 ug of PSLV-1:UegRska(Bb1)-Kpurouro2) (Adagrange catalog 59046) to provide pumprony selection marker. The next day, cells were transferred into 100-mm dishes and cultured in the presence of puromyosin (Sigma) at concentration 1 ug/ml. After two weeks, surviving clones were isolated using cloning cylinders (Corning, NY, USA). Genomic DNA was prepared from each single cell clone and LTR specific PCRs followed by gd purification; TA cloning and Sanger sequencing were performed. The clones showing the presence of on target CRISPR-Cang9 induced InDel mutations at target LTR 1st in integrated HIV-1 LTD sequence (\(n=6\)) together with two control clones were selected for further in vitro of target analysis. The list of potential OFF target sites in human genome for HIV-1 target LTR 1 and GagD was created using InCBUR design tool ([https://enechlin.com/](https://enechlin.com/), supplementary table 2). A total of three potential OFF target sites were chosen (the top scorer plus two to open specific potential of target sites, see supplementary table 2, highlighted in yellow) for PCR based screening in sided single cell clones. The potential OFF target regions were PCR-amplified, cloned into TA vector, and performed Sanger sequencing (3-6 sequences/single cell clone/single OFF target) (supplementary table 3).

The genetic variation analyses among the three treatments were performed through the next generation sequencing (by the Novogen NGS facility) and

Fig. 9: A working model for HIV-1 elimination. A cartoon illustration of the viral elimination strategy is shown for single LASER ART, AAV\({}_{y}\)-CRISPR-Cas9 injection groups and dual treatment groups. We highlight the observed restriction of viral infection by LASER ART and an inability to achieve elimination of virus by AAV\({}_{y}\)-CRISPR-Cas9 treatment alone. However, the sequential administration of LASER ART and AAV\({}_{y}\)-CRISPR-Cas9 can achieve viral elimination in a subset of animals. Why specific animals are cured of infection while others are not is incompletely understood but tied, in measure, to viral set points well and co-transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) with 1 ug
