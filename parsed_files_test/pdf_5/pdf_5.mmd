where \(k_{\rm{m}}\) is the non-radiative decay constant (that is, the observed decay constant \(k_{\rm{m}}\) for our non-emissive compounds). \(A\) is the pre-exponential factor (also known as the frequency factor), \(E_{\rm{s}}\) is the activation energy and \(k_{\rm{n}}\) and \(T\) are the Boltzmann constant and absolute temperature, respectively. As evident from the data in Fig. 3c, the time constant for ground-state recovery increases with decreasing temperature, indicating the presence of an activation energy for this process. Fitting the data for [Co(pyrro-bpy)\({}_{3}\)]" using equation (1), the activation energy was determined to be \(850\pm 50\) cm\({}^{-1}\) (Supplementary Fig. 9). Considering that the so-called 'typical' reaction, in which a rate constant doubles upon increasing the temperature from 300 K to 310 K, corresponds to an Arrhenius activation energy of -4,000 cm\({}^{-1}\), the value obtained for [Co(pyrro-bpy)\({}_{3}\)]" represents a small but nevertheless easily measurable barrier for ground-state recovery from the compound's lowest-energy ligand-field excited state.

The Firing equation frames the relaxation process in terms of free energy of activation (\(\Delta G\)), thereby providing insight into the activation enthalpy (\(\Delta H\)) and entropy (\(\Delta S\)) associated with ground-state recovery according to equation (2):

\[k_{\rm{m}}=\kappa\frac{k_{\rm{B}}T}{h}\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta G^{\rm{c}}}{k_{ \rm{B}}T}\right)=\kappa\frac{k_{\rm{B}}T}{h}\exp\left(\frac{\Delta S^{\rm{c}} }{k_{\rm{B}}}\right)\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta H^{\rm{c}}}{k_{\rm{B}}T}\right) \tag{2}\]

where \(\kappa\) is the transmission coefficient and \(h\) is Planck's constant. For [Co(pyrro-bpy)\({}_{3}\)]", the activation enthalpy and activation entropy were determined to be \(655\pm 40\) cm\({}^{-1}\) and \(-3.30\pm 0.15\) cm\({}^{-1}\)K\({}^{-1}\), respectively (Supplementary Fig. 8).

More relevant to our discussion is the transformation of equation (2) into semi-classical Marcus theory, equation (3):

\[k_{\rm{m}}=\frac{2\pi}{h}|H_{\rm{m}}|^{2}\frac{1}{\sqrt{4\pi k_{\rm{B}}T}}\exp \left[-\frac{\left(\Delta G_{0}+\lambda\right)^{2}}{4k_{\rm{B}}T}\right] \tag{3}\]

where \(\Delta G_{0}\) is driving force, \(\lambda\) represents reorganization energy, \(h\) is the reduced Planck's constant and \(H_{\rm{m}}\) is a constant that quantifies the electronic coupling between the two states involved in the process. Multiplying equation (3) through \(T^{22}\) and taking the naturalog allows us to rearrange the semi-classical Marcus expression into a form more amenable for fitting variable-temperature data of the kind illustrated in Fig. 3c (equation (4)):

\[\ln\left(k_{\rm{m}}\sqrt{T}\right)=\ln\left(\frac{2\pi}{h}|H_{\rm{m}}|^{2} \frac{1}{\sqrt{4\pi k_{\rm{B}}}}\right)-\left[\frac{\left(\Delta G_{0}+ \lambda\right)^{2}}{4k_{\rm{B}}T}\right]. \tag{4}\]

### Origin of the inverted-region behaviour

Since the intercept from equation (4) is proportional to \(|H_{ab}|^{2}/\sqrt{\lambda}\), a reliable value for \(\lambda\) now allows us to estimate the magnitude of electronic coupling between the \({}^{3}\Gamma_{1}\) and \({}^{4}\Lambda_{3}\) states as \(25.5\pm 1.0\) cm\({}^{-1}\); the (relatively) high degree of precision for this number stems from the quartic relationship between \(H_{ab}\) and \(\lambda\), giving rise to a fairly narrow range of values for \(H_{ab}\) that are consistent with the experimental data. We note that this is substantially larger than what has been reported for excited-state/ground-state coupling in Fe(II) polypyridyl(-5 cm\({}^{-1}\); ref. 54), a fact that we believe adds critical support to our assignment of the \({}^{3}\Gamma_{1}\) term as the lowest-energy excited state of [Co(pyro-pyy),]\({}^{3}\Gamma_{1}\).

It is not only the increase in the magnitude of \(H_{ab}\) relative to what is observed for Fe(II) analogues that we consider important, but also the trend we observe as a function of driving force. As indicated previously, it is well-established that the ground-state recovery process in Fe(II) polypyrid complexes corresponds to a \({}^{3}\Gamma_{2}+^{3}\Lambda_{1}\) conversion, a process wherein the spin of the system changes by two units (that is, \(S=2\) for the \({}^{3}\Gamma_{2}\) excited state to \(S=0\) for the \({}^{3}\Lambda_{1}\) ground state). There is no matrix element that allows one to directly couple two electronic states that differ by two spin quanta, so the coupling needed to effect ground-state recovery in these systems represents a second-order interaction whereby the \({}^{3}\Gamma_{2}\) state couples with a (non-thermally accessed) \(S=1\) state (for example, the \({}^{3}\Gamma_{1}\) state), which in turn couples to the \(S=0\) ground state. Because of the combined effect of the second-order coupling and the relative energy differences between the \({}^{3}\Gamma_{2}/^{3}\Gamma_{1}\) and \({}^{3}\Gamma_{1}/^{3}\Lambda_{2}\) gaps (Extended Data Fig. 1), the magnitude of \(H_{ab}\) is (I) small and (2) expected to slightly increase with increasing ligand-field strength. This is clearly at odds with the data obtained on our series of Co(III) complexes listed in Table 1, which necessitates that another mechanism must be considered.

Carrying out the same analysis for relaxation proceeding from the \({}^{3}\Gamma_{1}\) state, the expected trend in \(H_{ab}\) is fundamentally different. First, one can directly couple states characterized by \(S=1\) and \(S=0\), so the magnitude of the interaction will be intrinsically larger than a second-order interaction (at least qualitatively). More importantly, the fact that the two states would be directly interacting with each other means that the trend in the magnitude of the coupling constant should conform to simple perturbation theory; that is, as the states get further apart in energy, the degree to which they interact should decrease. This is precisely what we observe when we look at the value of \(H_{ab}\) as a function of 10Do: as the ligand-field strength increases across the series, the magnitude of \(H_{ab}\) systematically decreases. This trend indicates the presence of direct coupling between the ground state and the lowest-energy excited state in these Co(III) polypyrid compounds. We view this as additional compelling evidence that the ground-state recovery dynamics of these chromophores do, indeed proceed from the \({}^{3}\Gamma_{1}\) ligand-field excited state.

With this assignment in hand, we can now consider its consequence with regard to Marcus-normal-region versus Marcus-inverted-region behaviour. We have previously demonstrated that, all other things being equal, replacement of Fe(II) for Co(III) results in an -3,000 cm\({}^{-1}\) increase in the magnitude of 10Do (ref. 29). This corresponds to a shift to the right in the context of a Tanabe-Sugano diagram but more importantly as a vertical displacement of the zero-point energy of the lowest-energy excited state when viewed in terms of potential energy surfaces (Fig. 4). If the excited electronic state of a given Co(III) complex was the same as for its Fe(II) analogue, the reorganization energy associated with excited-state relaxation would be expected to be roughly the same. Put another way, if the horizontal displacement of the ground-state and excited-state potential energy surfaces- which is a proxy for the reorganization energy--as unperturbed, whether the increase in 10Do would be sufficient to transition from the Marcus-normal-region behaviour to the inverted behaviour that we observe (Fig. 4a) would be an open question. However, the increase in 10Do is only part of the story. As mentioned previously, the \({}^{3}\Gamma_{2}\) state derives from a \((t_{3})^{\rm(e)}(e^{\rm)}\) configuration, whereas the \({}^{3}\Gamma_{1}\) state corresponds to \((t_{3})^{\rm(e)}(e^{\rm)}\) configuration. The reduction in sigma anti-bonding character of the latter is the reason why the reorganization energy determined for the Co(III) complexes is roughly half of that found for Fe(II). What this means in the context of the potential energy surface diagram for the system is a diagonal shift in the relative position of the lowest-energy excited state, that is, an increase in zero-point energy coupled with decrease in the horizontal separation between the two potentials (Fig. 4b). Our assessment of the situation for ground-state recovery in the Co(III) complexes studied herein is summarized in Fig. 5.

## Conclusions

Variable-temperature ultrafast time-resolved absorption spectroscopy has been combined with DFT in an effort to understand the origin of the photophysical behaviour associated with ground-state recovery dynamics of a series of Co(III) tris-bipyridyl complexes. The experimental data were analysed through the lens of non-radiative decay theories ranging from a simple Arrhenius model to semi-classical Marcus theory.

Figure 4: **OriginofMarcus inverted region in Co(III).**a.**b.** Schematic representation of the relative change in the excited-state geometry and driving force for the ground-state recovery process from Fe(II) (**a**) to Co(III) (**b**)When combined with the results of DFT calculations benchmarked with experimental spectroscopic data, values for the driving force (\(\Delta G_{\text{o}}\)) and reorganization energy (\(\lambda\)) were obtained that indicated the magnitude of \(\Delta G_{\text{o}}\) across the series was nearly twofold larger than the reorganization energy, thereby confirming Marcus-inverted-region behaviour. Moreover, both the magnitude of \(H_{\text{o}}\) and its variation as a function of driving force strongly implicated the \({}^{3}\)T, ligand-field excited state as the lowest-energy excited state of all compounds in the series, in contrast to the \({}^{3}\)T, state in isoelectronic Fe(II) polypyridy. This change in the nature of the lowest-energy excited state-which leads to smaller reorganization energies-coupled with a larger zero-point energy difference conspire to place the excited-state relaxation dynamics of Co(III) polypyridy complexes in the Marcus inverted region.

While there is clearly room for improvement in certain aspects of this class of chromophores when considering future applications (for example, increased absorption cross-sections, excitation wavelengths that extend to longer wavelengths in the visible and enhanced excited-state lifetimes, to name a few) [35], we believe that the fundamental photophysical properties of these simple Co(III) polypyridyroll complexes that we have delineated in this report can serve as a roadmap for designing next generation photocatalysts that can leverage new opportunities afforded by accessing the Marcus inverted region in this manner.

### Methods

**Variable-temperature transient absorption spectroscopy**

Variable-temperature kinetic data can be modelled in a variety of ways depending on what sort of information is being sought. While the specific expressions stemming from these various models differ, those reliant on the Born-Oppenheimer approximation all have the general form shown in equation (5):

\[k_{m}=C\times T^{n}\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k_{\mathrm{B}}T}\right) \tag{5}\]

where the rate constant is expressed as the product of (1) an electronic term \(C\times T^{n}\) (where \(C\) is a constant(s) and the value of \(n\) is model dependent) and (2) a nuclear term, which is associated with a barrier (\(\Delta E\)) that follows Boltzmann-like statistics. The simplest of these is the Arrhenius model shown in equation (1), where \(k_{m}\) is the non-radiative decay constant, \(A\) is the pre-exponential factor (also known as the frequency factor), \(E_{\mathrm{s}}\) is the activation energy and \(k_{\mathrm{s}}\) and \(T\) are the Boltzmann constant and absolute temperature, respectively; referencing back to equation (1), this model is obtained for \(n=0\). A plot of \(\ln(k_{m})\) versus \(1/T\) yields a straight line with an intercept of \(\ln(A)\) and slope corresponding to \(-E_{\mathrm{s}}/k_{\mathrm{B}}\).

While the Arrhenius model provides useful information concerning the potential energy landscape associated with excited-state relaxation, its empirical nature prevents more detailed insight into the electronic structure of the compound that gives rise to those fitted parameters. The next level of sophistication is transition state theory, which can be derived from statistical mechanics and recasts the parameters describing temperature-dependent kinetics in terms of free energy. The Eyring equation, shown in equation (2), breaks the problem down in terms of enthalpies and entropies and corresponds to \(n=1\) in equation (1). A plot of \(\ln(k_{m}/T)\) versus \(1/T\) again yields a linear relationship with a slope now defined by the activation enthalpy (\(\Delta H\)), while the intercept reflects a convolution of the activation entropy (\(\Delta S^{5}\)) and the so-called transmission coefficient (\(\kappa\)). The latter is often assumed to have a value of \(1\), which allows for a determination of \(\Delta S^{5}\) and corresponds to the adiabatic limit in the vernacular of non-radiative decay theory.

More relevant to our discussion is the transformation of equation (2) into semi-classical Marcus theory, wherein the activation free energy is replaced by the well-known Marcus relation that considers the combined influence of driving force (\(\Delta G_{0}\)) and reorganization energy (\(\Omega\)) in the nuclear term and introduces the Landau-Zener formalism [16] to treat the electronic term quantum mechanically. This expression is shown in equation (3) where \(H_{\mathrm{ab}}\) is a constant that quantifies the electronic coupling between the two states involved in the process. Although Marcus theory was originally developed to describe outer-sphere electron-transfer processes, it is actually just a special case of the more general non-radiative decay theory and has been successfully applied to understand non-radiative kinetic processes in a wide variety of settings, including excited-state relaxation in transition metal complexes [23, 28]. According to Marcus theory, the non-radiative rate constant has a quadratic relationship with driving force and reorganization that gives rise to three distinct regimes of behaviour. When the driving force is smaller in magnitude than the amount of energy required to structurally reorganize the system from the equilibrium configuration of the excited state to that of the ground state (that is, when \(|\Delta G_{0}|<\lambda\); Fig. 2b), \(k_{m}\) increases with increasing zero-point energy difference. This is referred to as the 'normal' region and corresponds to our intuition that, as the thermodynamic favourability of the reaction increases, the rate constant for the reaction also increases; this regime also corresponds to the 'inverse energy gap law" alluded to previously. When the free energy difference becomes equal in magnitude to the reorganization energy, the exponential term in equation (3) collapses to unity and the rate constant is dictated primarily by the electronic coupling between the two states (\(H_{\mathrm{ab}}\)). This is the 'barrierless' region and is characterized by a very weak, inverted temperature dependence in the rate constant that scales as \(T^{\mathrm{\prime}12}\). Further increase in the driving force lead to the counterintuitive result of reintroducing the barrier: this is the 'inverted region' (that is, the energy gap law), where the rate constant starts to decrease again as the exergoncity of the reaction increases (that is, Fig. 2a). This is the revolutionary idea that Marcus presented more than 70 years ago [30] that was ultimately verified in the classic work of Closs and Miller [31, 32]. We note that the overall form of equation (3) is again reminiscent of equation (5) for \(n=-\)\(\nu_{2}\) and a barrier described by the now well-known Marcus relation of \((\Delta G_{0}+\lambda)^{\mathrm{\prime}}4\lambda\).

Multiplying equation (3) through by \(T^{\mathrm{\prime}2}\) and taking the natural log allows us to rearrange the semi-classical Marcus expression into a form more amenable for fitting variable-temperature data of the kind illustrated in Fig. 3c. This expression is shown in equation (4), where a plot of \(\ln(k_{m}\sqrt{T})\) versus \(1/T\) produces the linear correlation shown in Fig. 3d. Equation (4) indicates that the slope of the plot contains information related to the driving force, \(\Delta G_{0}\), which equates to the zero-point energy difference between the lowest-energy ligand-field excited state and the ground state, and the reorganization energy \(\lambda\), which informs on the difference in the equilibrium geometries between those two states. The reorganization energy also contributes to the value of the intercept, although this parameter from the fit is dominated by the magnitude of the electronic coupling (\(H_{\mathrm{ab}}\)).

### Computational details for assessing reorganization energy

The geometry of the singlet ground state of [Co(pyrro-bpy),3] was optimized using the B3LYP functional and incorporating empirical dispersion corrections (that is, B3LYP + D2). The optimized structure compared favourably with the experimentally determined single-crystal X-ray structure [33], with average Co-Nbond lengths that differed on the order of only 1% between the experimental and optimized structures. Equilibrium geometries for the lowest-energy triplet and quintet spins states, which will ultimately allow us to assess relative zero-point energies of the excited states, were also optimized. As expected, both are ligand-field in nature as illustrated in the spin density map shown in Extended Data Fig. 1b (inset) and Supplementary Fig. 1f. The optimized triplet geometry was found to be jahn-Teller distorted, consistent with expectations for a multielectronic term state deriving from a \((\nu_{2})^{\mathrm{\prime}}(e^{\mathrm{\prime}})^{2}\) configuration. The equilibrium geometry of the quintet state was found to be more symmetric, again consistent with the \((\nu_{2})^{\mathrm{\prime}}(e^{\mathrm{\prime}})^{2}\) configuration, where the degeneracy needed to effect a jahn-Teller distortion exists only in the weakly anti-bonding \(n\)-symmetry \(\nu_{2}\) orbits. Additional details concerning these optimized geometries can be found in Supplementary Table 7.

Since it is well known that the inclusion of Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange preferentially stabilizes high-spin configurations [33], we sought to create tailored B3LYP functionals by taking advantage of the experimental data we possessed on the electronic structure of [Co(pyrro-bpy),3]" from steady-state absorption spectroscopy. Using the experimentally determined 'A' \the initial state to that of the final state without actually undergoing the transformation. Conceptually, this equates to moving along the potential energy surface corresponding to the'reactant' (in our case the lowest-energy ligand-field excited state) from its equilibrium geometry at the minimum of its potential energy surface to a configuration corresponding to the equilibrium geometry of the 'product' (that is, the ground state). This can be simulated computationally by simply taking the difference between the optimized, zero-point energy of the excited ligand-field state at its equilibrium geometry and the energy of that same electronic state upon excitation from the ground state (that is, the Franck-Condon state). The latter can be determined computationally but is also available for our compounds experimentally, as it corresponds to the 770 nm maximum of the \({}^{1}\)A\({}_{n}\) + \({}^{7}\)T\({}_{1}\) absorption feature observed in the compound's electronic absorption spectrum (Fig. 3a, inset)[39]. Both of these approaches yield a very similar value of -3,000 cm\({}^{-1}\) (0.37 eV; Supplementary Table 9). We note that these calculated differences are virtually insensitive to the percentage of HF exchange incorporated into the functional (Extended Data Fig. 1c), an observation that provides us with added confidence in the conclusions being drawn from the calculations.

To gain further insightful into the degree to which the solvent may be influencing the excited-state dynamics in our system, we carried out measurements on [Co(pyrro-bpy),3][40] in a series of different solvents covering a broad range of static dielectric constants (for example, from 9,00 for dichloromethane to 47.24 for dimethyl sulfoxide). As expected, the ligand-field absorption band (\({}^{1}\)A\({}_{1}\) + \({}^{1}\)T) was found to be largely insensitive to changes in the solvent due to its localization on the metal centre (Supplementary Fig. 6). The normalized transient absorption kinetic traces following photoexcitation at 510 nm are shown in Supplementary Fig. 6b; a plot of ground-state recovery time constants as a function of static dielectric constant as well as solvent polarizability are shown in Supplementary Fig. 6c,d, respectively. The data, while not exhibiting a strong correlation to either of these macroscopic solvent properties, reveal variations in the kinetics suggestive of a small but nevertheless measurable contribution to the total reorganization energy for ground-state recovery from the solvent. This is qualitatively consistent with our previously published study on the influence of outer-sphere reorganization on ground-state recovery dynamics of [Fe(bpy),3][40], where a contribution from the solvent was attributed to differences in solvation due to the large volume change associated with the high-spin to low-spin conversion[41].
